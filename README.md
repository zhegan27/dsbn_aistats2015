## Deep Sigmoid Belief Network

The Matlab Code for the AISTATS 2015 paper "Learning Deep Sigmoid Belief Networks with Data Augmentation"

Created by Zhe Gan (zhe.gan@duke.edu), Duke University, ECE department.

## Introduction

This code implement the deep sigmoid belief network (DSBN), from the 2015 AISTATS paper with the same title.
This source code is made publicly available for reproducibility purposes, it is not optimized for speed, 
minimally documented but fully functional.
